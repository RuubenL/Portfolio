          <p class="post__text text">DOK is an area in Ghent where different events and activities are held. We had to create a website for DOK, that showed all their activities and events. It had to be a responsive website, that showed all the info about DOK and where the user could filter the events from an overview.</p>

            <p>When I started with the assignment, I wanted to try a whole different style for the design as I was used to do, I wanted to challenge myself to go out of my comfort zone and try something new. That’s how I came up with a design with allot of shapes that supports the content and I used allot of colours instead of keeping it simple.</p>

<p>The first week I struggled with the structure of the design, how everything should be placed, what I would place on the home screen, and what should be on the detail page. When I knew what I would place where, I created wireframes for web and mobile and I build up the database.</p>

<p>As I started designing, I struggled with the new direction I wanted to take. Everything ‘screamed’ to much for attention, and the structure didn’t seem all right. So I made a couple different variations of the design until I was happy. The colours of the events were different depending on the location of where they were held. I placed the 2 next upcoming events on the home page, found a filter system that would work, and placed recommendations and the next similar event on the detail page of an event.</p>

<p>Transferring the design in code was a task that took me about 5 days. I came across different challenging parts where I really had to stop and think about how I should code them. I eventually finished the project, got everything to work nicely, and was happy that I took another direction. It was a challenging but fun project.</p>

<p>Sadly enough, the website doesn’t work anymore because the school emptied the databases, and I have an error now. But I made an Invision mockup, so you can still see all the aspects of the website.</p>
