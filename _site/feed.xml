&lt;p&gt;After a full week of brainstorming We found a concept that was based on traveling. With our campaign we want to tell the youth, that you don’t have to travel to see art, because it is just around the corner. We called it “Don’t look to far for culture”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put the sentence on everyday objects like tote bags, stickers and coasters, so that people would link the MSK with going on vacation when living their normal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, we made a web application that creates your “vacation” through the MSK. You have to choose 3 countries where you like the culture of or would like to go, the app calculates how much you need to travel to get there. Luckily the MSK is just around the corner and you get a personal tour from the website to your likings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">We started with interviewing people in the streets of Ghent and asked about what they knew about the MSK, and what their interests were in general.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">xPuff</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/05/11/kickstarter.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="xPuff" /><published>2017-05-11T15:28:47+02:00</published><updated>2017-05-11T15:28:47+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/05/11/kickstarter</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/05/11/kickstarter.html">&lt;p&gt;I searched about 2 days for a project that would be suited for the assignment, eventually I found the xPuff project. It’s a mechanism that filters noise of the surroundings, that you attach on your apple earpods microphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created sketches of how I saw the flow of the video and of all the scenes there had to be. I wanted to create a story about a character that has trouble calling his friend, and show the positive points of using the xPuff. But I wanted to create an imaginary character, it didn’t had to look ‘realistic’, it was placed in a fantasy world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with creating the scenery, all the different objects, and the character in illustrator, then I imported everything in after effects and started to animate everything. The first weeks I made a solid foundation of the motion video, I made a script for the voice-over and looked for a suiting song. The first version was synced on the music and voice-over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got feedback and started to adjust the animation to the feedback that I got, I placed minor animations in the details, and tweaked everything until the movements of the character looked natural and I was satisfied with the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a long and difficult assignment, but I liked working on it, making everything perfect how I want it. And creating a project that I can be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I searched about 2 days for a project that would be suited for the assignment, eventually I found the xPuff project.

&lt;p&gt;We struggled a bit with the Design at first, we couldn’t really find a design that would be different then the others, it was to simple, so we decided to start over, and go in a whole other direction. The design we eventually came up with, was insprired on Spotify’s duo-tone effect, we decided to combine it with shapes and fitting colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the development part of the project, I focused myself on the soundbar React component, the CSS and JS part, and making the website responsive. While Benoit did html, the bottom React component, and basic css.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Freddie Mercury seemed the most logical option for us, because we were able to find a lot of content and so we would be able to make a story around his life.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dok Gent</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/01/20/dokgent.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dok Gent" /><published>2017-01-20T14:28:47+01:00</published><updated>2017-01-20T14:28:47+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/01/20/dokgent</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/01/20/dokgent.html">&lt;p&gt;//&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">//</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">orca game</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/01/11/orcagame.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="orca game" /><published>2017-01-11T14:28:47+01:00</published><updated>2017-01-11T14:28:47+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/01/11/orcagame</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/01/11/orcagame.html">&lt;p&gt;//&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">//</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">google doodle</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/01/09/googledoodle.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="google doodle" /><published>2017-01-09T14:28:47+01:00</published><updated>2017-01-09T14:28:47+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/01/09/googledoodle</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/01/09/googledoodle.html">&lt;p&gt;//&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">//</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">blauw</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2016/11/19/blauw.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="blauw" /><published>2016-11-19T14:28:47+01:00</published><updated>2016-11-19T14:28:47+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2016/11/19/blauw</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2016/11/19/blauw.html">&lt;p&gt;//&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">//</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The jetsetters festival</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2016/06/10/trucks.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The jetsetters festival" /><published>2016-06-10T15:28:47+02:00</published><updated>2016-06-10T15:28:47+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2016/06/10/trucks</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2016/06/10/trucks.html">&lt;p&gt;//&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">//</summary></entry></feed>
