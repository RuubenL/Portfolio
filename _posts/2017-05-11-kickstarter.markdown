brief: "We had to create a video that explained a Kickstarter project. We had to trigger the people to sponsor the project, and explain what it's about. The result had to be a 2D animation spot of 30 seconds, supported with english voice-over and music."

I searched about 2 days for a project that would be suited for the assignment, eventually I found the xPuff project. It's a mechanism that filters noise of the surroundings, that you attach on your apple earpods microphone.

I created sketches of how I saw the flow of the video and of all the scenes there had to be. I wanted to create a story about a character that has trouble calling his friend, and show the positive points of using the xPuff. But I wanted to create an imaginary character, it didn't had to look 'realistic', it was placed in a fantasy world.

I started with creating the scenery, all the different objects, and the character in illustrator, then I imported everything in after effects and started to animate everything. The first weeks I made a solid foundation of the motion video, I made a script for the voice-over and looked for a suiting song. The first version was synced on the music and voice-over.

I got feedback and started to adjust the animation to the feedback that I got, I placed minor animations in the details, and tweaked everything until the movements of the character looked natural and I was satisfied with the result.

It was a long and difficult assignment, but I liked working on it, making everything perfect how I want it. And creating a project that I can be proud of.
