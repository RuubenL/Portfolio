brief: "For this assignment we had to create an animation about a holiday for the google header. We had to build-up 'Google' in minimum 10sec."

When we were given the assignment we had to look for a holiday that we wanted to use as a theme for the animation. I chose Chinese new-year as holiday, the Chinese culture has always fascinated me and I was excited to start the project.

The Chinese new-year has different symbolic attributes that they use during the holiday, like fortune cookies, oranges etc. I used those elements to create letters and make them come in the screen in a logic and fun way.

It was a very fun project and I learned allot during the project about after effects.
