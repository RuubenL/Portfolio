brief: "We had to make a website for a radio station in Belgium, Nostalgie. The assignment was to create a website as a tribute for a famous singer and create an interesting one-pager, with elements of motion, and React about him/her."

Freddie Mercury seemed the most logical option for us, because we were able to find a lot of content and so we would be able to make a story around his life.

We struggled a bit with the Design at first, we couldn't really find a design that would be different then the others, it was to simple, so we decided to start over, and go in a whole other direction. The design we eventually came up with, was insprired on Spotify's duo-tone effect, we decided to combine it with shapes and fitting colors.

For the development part of the project, I focused myself on the soundbar React component, the CSS and JS part, and making the website responsive. While Benoit did html, the bottom React component, and basic css.
