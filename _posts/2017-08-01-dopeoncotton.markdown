brief: "I worked at dope on cotton in Antwerp for 2 months. My job there was to make T-shirt designs for clients and for in the store. I also had the possibility to create my own design during the time I worked there. I also had to print the T-shirts and work in the shop."

The images below are some examples of designs I made during the time I worked at dope on cotton. My own T-shirt design that I created was the cotton plant. I made different variations on the design depending on what color of T-shirt it would go.

I also created a design for the gay parade in Antwerp, I chose different gay symbols or people that support the gay community and looked for silhouettes of them. I placed those in a 4x4 grid and placed a quote of Freddie Mercury below.
