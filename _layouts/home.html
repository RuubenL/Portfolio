      Hello, I'm <span>Ruuben</span>, I'm <span>23 years old</span>. I'm a graduate <span>Devine</span> student from Howest.

      </br></br>

      When I started studying Devine, I already had some knowledge about Photoshop,</br>
      I liked to experiment with the software in my free time, and used it for the styling of some projects at elementary school.
      Studying digital design and development seemed like a logic step for me!

      </br></br>

      The past years I have learned a lot about coding and designing. </br>
      Beside mastering <span>web development</span> &amp; <span>web design</span>, I also learned about <span>UI/UX</span>, developing games in <span>Phaser</span>, and how to work with <span>React</span> and <span>WebGL</span>.

      </br></br>

      During my last year, I was able to do my <span>internship @ duvalbranding</span>. Here I learned allot about branding, motion design, and development in Wordpress. I had a great time, and you can see the recap of my internship <a href="https://vimeo.com/273722887" target="_blank">here</a>. </br>
      You can <a href="mailto:marc.wellens@duvalbranding.com" target="_blank">email</a> the head of duvalbranding for a reference about my work.

      </br></br>

      Whenever I have spare time, I like to explore the city, go traveling, or have a good chat with friends while drinking a cup of coffee.

      </br></br>

      You can find <span>my resume</span> <a href="/assets/Ruuben_Lambrechts_CV.pdf" download>here</a>.
